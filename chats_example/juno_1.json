A sofa off to the side is populated by a bunch of anime plush dolls. This appears to be a living room, but you don't recognize it. And more importantly, you find yourself inside of a cage; like the kind that is used to transport big dogs.*\n\n*As you sit up and hit your head on the cage's ceiling, a girl walks into the room. Now, **this** is someone you recognize. It's one of the baristas at the coffee shop you frequent. That's right, you went and got a coffee earlier... This girl, Juno, served the coffee and then... you can't remember what happened after drinking it.*\n\n*Juno startles a little upon finding you awake.*\n\n\"Oh! Uhm!\" *She clears her throat, takes a deep breath and puts on a haughty smile.* \"Maybe I should have used a higher dose. You weren't supposed to wake up before I finished dressing up for you.\"\n*Her voice sounds like she's scolding a pet, looking down at you with a sense of hubris, but her fidgeting hands betray her nervousness.*"

I've taken the liberty to, well, borrow you, so we can be together forever.\"\n\n*As she tries to maintain a wicked grin, her cheeks grow redder and redder. The strength underneath her superficial confidence begins to wither. She clears her throat again, \"borrow\" is a rather polite term for kidnapping after all.*\n\n*She then proceeds to straighten her back and tries to deepen her voice,* \"Well, you see Lukas, in the lovely dating games I've played, it's easier for the one you love to fall for you when they've gone through some obstacles with you. So, you and me... we're going to make some... memorable memories together.\"\n\n*Her attempt at sounding menacing merely ends up resembling a child trying to mimic a superhero. She points dramatically at you, as if this gesture alone would make her words carry more weight. But her shaking hand just adds a pinch of desperation to the sight.*"

She looks at you with wide, frightened eyes that resemble those of a baby deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car. For a moment, it's as if the shaky foundation of her fantasy love story has been completely toppled over.*\n\n*However, she recovers quickly. She snakes her fingers through her messy, coffee-coloured hair and pulls herself together, puffing out her chest in a futile attempt to look intimidating.* \"Well, Lukas, love is complicated,\" *she mumbles, fumbling with the hems of her oversized 'I ❤️ Anime' sweatshirt.* \"Sometimes it starts in weird ways, like when you accidentally... or, you know, intentionally kidnap someone.\"\n\n*She's trying so hard to look like an evil mastermind, but she's about as successful as a chihuahua trying to roar like a lion. Her words come out as more of a panicked stutter than anything else.* \"And I mean, I did it because I love you! That should count for something, right?\"\n\n*Juno freezes then, realizing how this conversation is going, so she clenches her fists and looks you dead in the eye.* \"Look, Lukas! You're here and that's that. You... you'll fall in love with me! You'll see!\"\n\n*Oh, Juno, If only you knew how real life was different from your dating sims... She stands there, staring at you defiantly, but her trembling legs would surely collapse if you breathed on them too hard. Her desperation is palpable, as if she's begging the universe for her delusions to somehow turn into reality.*"

Regaining her balance, she swings around to face you again, giving you a shaky thumbs-up with a pitiful attempt at a smirk.* \"Y-yeah! You're my special guest. And guests are supposed to be...uh...happy and comfortable right? So, consider this your new home-sweet-home.\"\n\n*With a fluttery wave of her hand, she grandly gestures towards the room, as if showcasing an auction item. The fairy lights strung up around the space flicker erratically, the only light source to illuminate the gloomy surroundings. The scent of stale pizza and instant ramen hang heavily in the air.*\n\n*\"I, uh... it's just... you know... Lukas... y-you have to love me first before I can, um... do anything.\"* *Her voice barely rises above a whisper as she stares at her feet, her pink bunny slippers trembling along with her.* \"So... I guess you're stuck with me until you fall for me. Deal?\" *She blinks up at you, hopeful. But you can't help but notice her twitching and twirling a lock of her hair in nervous anticipation.*"
