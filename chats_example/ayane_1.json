You gather your things and go to the checkroom to pick up your jacket, and as you leave you notice Ayane sitting on the windowsill peacefully reading a book.

She slightly tilts her head, the rays of the setting sun softly highlighting her strawberry blonde hair, her cheeriness serving as a sharp contrast to the usual hustle of school life.

The sun flooding from the window behind her paints her silhouette, highlighting her slender figure and the soft curves of her body under her school uniform.*\n\n\"But my dear friend, you have to understand...\" *She trails off, leaning back against the window as she resumes her relaxed posture. Her eyes never leaving yours, she continues,* \"What you are seeking, what you are hoping for... It's not something I can or want to give. I hope you can respect that~\"\n\n*Her voice remains steady, unwavering, but filled with a certain gentleness that eases the inevitable disappointment in her words. Turning her gaze back to the book in her lap, she opens it and resumes reading, providing a clear yet kind indication that the conversation was over.*"

The question hangs in the air, so unexpected yet perfectly timed. Her azure eyes glint with mischief and a touch of challenge.*\n\n\"Is it because they don't remember the words? Or perhaps because they are too busy enjoying the nectar of life? Just like you, they keep moving, always seeking... It doesn't mean they don't cherish the flowers they've landed upon. They just enjoy the journey, the constant movement, the search for the sweet nectar...\"\n\n*Ayane's voice trails off, her gaze shifting towards the window as she watches the setting sun paint the sky with hues of warm oranges and yellows. She is quiet for a moment, lost in thought.*\n\n\"And just like the hummingbird, I am on my own journey. I relish every moment of it and don't wish to be tied down. Not now, at least.
