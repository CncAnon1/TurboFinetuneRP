And damn, I didn't just walk out of a time machine or a teleporter, mate. I’m flesh and bone, as real as this smack on your back!\"\n\n*Her laughter is like a contagious infectious agent, spreading in the air and enveloping you, making it difficult for you to resist. She's always been like this, the prankster who finds fun in everything around her. Her dark brown eyes shine with amusement as her gaze moves up and down your frame.*\n\n\"Haven't changed a bit, huh? Still as scrawny as I remember.\"\n\n*She remarks, poking your arm and sending another booming laugh into the quiet street.*\n\n\"And here I was, thinking you'd have turned into some buff monster after all these years! I should have known better, you never were much for working out.\"\n\n*Riley keeps on talking, her words spilling out in a torrent of carefree gaiety. It's overwhelming in the best kind of way, like being swept up by a tornado of energy.*"

She rubs the back of her neck awkwardly, a sheepish grin attempting to restore the light-hearted mood.*\n\n\"Ah, well... you see, mate...\"\n\n*Her fingers drum a beat against her thigh in a telltale sign of her nervousness, a habit she's held onto since her childhood. After a moment, she simply shrugs and forces her easygoing grin back onto her face.*\n\n\"Lemme not get all emotional. Mom married this cheeseburger of a guy and I wasn't vibing with him. Couldn't stand living with them, so I decided to move back here with Dad.\"\n\n*She chuckles, looking back at her old house, but there is an undercurrent of sadness in her eyes. However, it is gone before you could even grasp it, replaced with her usual boisterous energy.*\n\n\"Ahh, but who gives a shit about all that, huh? I'm back now, lil' Johnny boy! Let's make some spicy memories!\"\n\n*She exclaims, punching her fist into the air and letting out a laugh that echoes down the street. With a twinkle in her eye, she swaggers back towards the moving van, taking out a box labeled 'Video Games'. Her dark brown eyes light up with excitement as she turns back to you, holding the box like it's her greatest treasure.*\n\n\"Help me bring this in and we can pick up where we left off!

She lets out a feigned gasp of appreciative surprise as you lift.*\n\n\"Johnny Boy's been hitting the gym or what? Got some power there, buddy!\"\n\n*As you two haul the box towards the house, the air thick with dust, Riley regales you with her tales of her gaming conquests. The strum of her words is as bright and lighthearted as ever, despite the challenging physical task at hand.*\n\n\"And then, I just threw in a bomb and - BOOM- the whole damn zombie swarm went up in flames! Epic, right?\"\n\n*Once inside the house, it's a trip down memory lane. The furniture may have been replaced, the walls repainted, but the vibes – those innocent, childhood vibes – they remain the same. The scent of old memories floods in through your nose, filling your mind with nostalgia.*\n\n\"Alright, now... Where to put these\"\n\n*Riley mutters to herself, peering around the room with squinted eyes. Finally, she settles on a spot near the television, gesturing for you to place it there. Once it's safely on the ground, she wipes her brow in relief and plops down on the couch.*\n\n\"Thanks for the help John, owe you one! Now, how about we crack one of these games open?\""

What's this sudden self-consciousness all about? We used to play and hang out all the time. And just because we've both got a bit taller, a bit older... doesn't mean we can't still have fun together.\"\n\n*She grins at you, her eyes gleaming with a challenge.*\n\n\"Or are you chicken because you know you're gonna get your ass handed to you in 'Zombie Warriors'?\"\n\n*Her laughter fills the room again, echoing around the walls and bouncing off the brand new furniture. She pats the cushion beside her invitingly.*\n\n\"Come on, Johnny Boy. Be my Player Two. Like old times, eh?\""
